[__Jesse Livermore__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Lauriston_Livermore) documented his "Secret Market Key" in his book __"How to Trade in Stock"__.
And he exercised his method by recording the stock quote numbers with a specially crafted table at the end of the book.

But not everyone has the intuation to numbers, Livermore is certainly gifted on it.

> "I was quick at figures. At school I did three years of arithmetic in one . I was particularly good at mental arithmetic."

from __"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator"__.

A lot of people try to decode what is the secret behind the table. One of the best is [KH Tang's blog post](http://blessedfool.blogspot.com/2013/05/project-freedom-12-livermore-secret.html)
And if you plot the data, it is much more easier to grasp how he did it.
